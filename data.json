Do not apply if you are not familiar with both. Thanks.\n\nI have a developer working on an application using Parse.com as the data store. I have very limited knowledge using Parse.com, so I\\'m running into issues retrieving information from a table, and posting new data to the tables.\n\nHere\\'s what I\\'m needing done:\n\n1. Modify an existing query to pull down information sorted by date. I have a query with the information I require already set up, but instead of it being all in one table, I\\'d like it to be in separate tables by date. Also, I\\'d like the tables to be sorted by time. In other words, this would show all dates in sections, then the times below the date sorted.\n\n2. Create a form that posts to the Parse.com tables. I have managed to create a form that will connect to the table and fill in a field, but I am struggling with two things...posting a date to the table, and posting a user. The user part is made complicated by it being a pointer in the \\\"Scheduled\\\" table to a \\\"User\\\" table. I would need the form to save their name and info to the \\\"User\\\" table and then create the pointer in the \\\"Scheduled\\\" table.\n\nThis could be simple work for someone that knows their way around Parse.com and Javascript, but sadly that\\'s not me. Please let me know of any projects you\\'ve worked on with Parse.com as this is centered around this.\n\nThank you!","type":"Hourly","budget":"0","engagement":"Part-time - 10-30 hrs\/week","engagement_weeks":"Less than 1 week","contractor_tier":"1","skills":""},{"id":"~01ae160c4cbffa7c72","url":"https:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/Forum-and-Inquiry_%7E01ae160c4cbffa7c72?source=rss","created_at":"2015-11-14 19:30:51","title":"Forum and Inquiry","description":"Develop a Forum where users can discuss topics.\nDevelop an Inquiry form so users can ask questions before purchasing subscription.","type":"Hourly","budget":"0","engagement":"Full-time - 30+ hrs\/week","engagement_weeks":"Less than 1 month","contractor_tier":"3","skills":""},{"id":"~01fecdf9344ab2f2d4","url":"https:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/Web-Developer-Designer_%7E01fecdf9344ab2f2d4?source=rss","created_at":"2015-11-14 19:30:36","title":"Web Developer | Designer","description":"I am seeking assistance with our website.

The website has been redesigned recently, but should be improved upon continuously. Responsive design for the website is achieved using CSS3 Flexbox. A consistent look and feel for the UI is achieved using Angular Material Design.\n\nApplicants will need to be an expert in LESS and CSS. LESS is compiled to CSS with the use of an autoprefixer plugin. We are especially interested in someone with expertise with animation using CSS. Applicants must also be knowledgeable with AngularJS and JavaScript. The frontend developer position will not need to create AngularJS Controllers and Directives, but needs to be capable of using them properly in the correct context. The AngularJS Controllers and Directives are written in CoffeeScript, so the ability to read CoffeeScript will be a plus.\n\nApplicants must have strong communication skills. GitHub will be used to track issues. The design changes will require multiple iterations and may at times be shelved in favor of a different approach. Changes will be based on feedback from various sources. The developer must be proactive in this process. Ask questions when needed! English will be used in all forms of communication.\n\nIf interested, please answer the following question with your application:\n\n1. Describe your experience with HTML, LESS, and CSS. Provide samples if available.\n2. Describe your experience with AngularJS and JavaScript.\n3. Have you used a task runner to build a website?\n\nPlease be aware that the development environment is set up using Virtualbox and Vagrant running Ubuntu 14.04. The VM will be running a recent version (if not the latest version) of NodeJS. Gulp is used to run tasks from the command line. Applicants will need to be comfortable in this environment. We use Macs for development, but the VM has been tested on Windows 10 and Linux. Please note that Win10 can be eccentric.\n\nFinally, Git (with the repo hosted on GitHub) is used for source control. Your GitHub username will be required if you are considered for this position.\n\nRequired Skills\n\n* Strong communications skills (English)\n* Expert with LESS and CSS\n* Knowledgeable with JavaScript and AngularJS\n* Familiar with Git, GitHub, Angular Material Design, CoffeeScript, Virtualbox, Vagrant, NodeJS, NPM, Gulp, and Linux","type":"Hourly","budget":"0","engagement":"As needed - Less than 10 hrs\/week","engagement_weeks":"","contractor_tier":"2","skills":""},{"id":"~01000aea0a594b77bf","url":"https:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/Wordpress-general-upkeep-and-development_%7E01000aea0a594b77bf?source=rss","created_at":"2015-11-13 01:52:22","title":"Wordpress - general upkeep and development","description":"I\\'m looking for someone to help with the backend of my wordpress site.","type":"Hourly","budget":"0","engagement":"Part-time - 10-30 hrs\/week","engagement_weeks":"","contractor_tier":"1","skills":"html, wordpress, wordpress-plugin"},{"id":"~013789302835d1ab3d","url":"https:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/Web-portal-for-Dynamics-CRM-read-write-search-the_%7E013789302835d1ab3d?source=rss","created_at":"2015-11-13 01:51:54","title":"Web portal for Dynamics CRM to read\/write\/search the DB","description":"Hi there,\n\nWe intend to create a web portal on a public website to connect to our MS Dynamics CRM for read\/write\/search purposes.\n\nAli","type":"Fixed","budget":"500","engagement":"Full-time - 30+ hrs\/week","engagement_weeks":"","contractor_tier":"2","skills":""},{"id":"~010401aba55bd5a9d1","url":"https:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/Web-Developer-for-Consumer-Businesses_%7E010401aba55bd5a9d1?source=rss","created_at":"2015-11-13 01:50:34","title":"Web Developer for Consumer Businesses","description":"At PennyPop, we build businesses that delight the world.
